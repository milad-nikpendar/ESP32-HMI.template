# 📁 src/

Main application logic for the ESP32-HMI project.  
Connects to UI code from `esp32-hmi/ui/` (generated by [EEZ Studio](https://github.com/eez-open/studio)) and uses [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl) for rendering.

PlatformIO compiles all `.cpp` files here.  
UI headers are included via `build_flags` in `platformio.ini`.
