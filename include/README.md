# 📁 include/

Holds header (`.h`) files for the ESP32-HMI project.

- Public interfaces, constants, macros, and function/class declarations.  
- Used by `.cpp` files in `src/` and other modules.  
- Keep only declarations here; put implementations in `src/`.  
- Use `#pragma once` or include guards.
